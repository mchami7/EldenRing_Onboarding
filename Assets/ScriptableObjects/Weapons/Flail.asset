  Title: Flail
  Description: " Flails\_have long reach and can inflict single powerful strikes
    against hostile characters, but they are rather slow.\_  Flails\_cannot be parried.
    However, unlike Whips, it can be used to perform critical attacks.  Flails\_can
    be modified by a number of\_Ashes of War\_to change their\_Skills\_or\_Damage
    Type, so play around with them and see what you like as you acquire more.  The
    default\_Art of War on most flails, Spinning Chain, is not available as a separate
    Ash of War as of Patch 1.03. This means you cannot change the\_damage affinity
    of these flails without overwriting Spinning Chain."
