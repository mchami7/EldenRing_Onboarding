"# EldenRing_Onboarding" 

This project has been developed in a group as part of my Digital Media module at Kingston University. The brief was to provide an easier onboarding experience to the player base that is having a hard time playing Elden Ring.

Our group was made of 5 user experience designers, 1 animator, 1 game designer, and 1 programmer (me).

The solution we developed was to provide a standalone app that navigates the 3D map of Elden Ring with extra queues and info placed on the map to allow players to understand the game more fully. The idea was to not disrupt the actual design of the game and rather more provide an optional experience for players that need more.
